## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Charging required libraries
library(dplyr)


```

```{r load and clean data}
# Unzip and read csv data
activity <- unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
rm(activity)

# Primary clean-up: omit NA values and convert data variable to date format
data <- na.omit(data)
date <- as.Date(data$date)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{histogram}
# Daily steps
steps_day <- data <- 

hist(x = activity$steps, main = "Histograma de Edad", 
     xlab = "Steps", ylab = "Frecuencia",
     col = "purple")

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?






## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
